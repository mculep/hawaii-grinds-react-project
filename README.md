## Objective:

Mini React project that uses, Hooks & Routers.

## What is `Ono Hawaii Eats?:

'Ono Hawaii Eats is a simple app that displays some of the best places to eat on Oahu, Hawaii.

## API used:

I created my own API since the API's online were limited to what type of app I wanted to create. Here is the link to my API [repo](https://hawaii-grinds-api.herokuapp.com/hawaii-food). If you're interested and want to create your own API, refer to this [link](https://youtu.be/FLnxgSZ0DG4). She does a great job explaining.

## Tools & Languages used:

-   React.js
-   JSX
-   CSS
-   Figma
-   Procreate
-   Adobe Illustrator

## Takeaways:

Features that I would like to add are:

-   Filtered search of the type of food
-   Filtered search to different Hawaiian islands not just Oahu.
-   Add more places
