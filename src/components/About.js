            <p>'Ono in Hawaiian means "delicious." I created this App because I was born and raised in Hawaii! Since I have years of experience on the island, hundreds of people ask me "where is the best place to eat when I come visit?" Usually, I send tons of links via email or text- but now they can see all of the highly rated eateries conveniently in one place!
