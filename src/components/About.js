            <p>'Ono in hawaiian means "delicious". I created this app because a lot of people ask me what are some good places to eat when I visit Hawaii? I end up sending them a bunch links via email or text. This app shows a small list of places that are recommended by me and other locals. If you ever visit Hawaii, then you want to experience 'ono hawaii eats from the people that know Hawaii foods the best. </p>
